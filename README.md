# Sorters
Common sorting functions implemented in C++, initially created for educational purposes but maintained for reference. If you find this helpful I am happy, but this is essentially just memory jogger for various algorithms.

#Compilation
Sorters is seperated into another file, if for some strange reason you decide to use it. Compile it first with a -c flag and then compile the driver.
